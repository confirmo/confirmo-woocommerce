= How can I withdraw my funds? =

You can withdraw your funds through Settlements and Payouts:
<b>Settlements</b> are daily, weekly or monthly outgoing transactions to your linked bank account or crypto wallet. Settlements can be used to send Fiat, but also crypto and stablecoins, and work on a set-and-forget basis like traditional standing orders.

<b>Payouts</b> are one-time, on-demand transactions to a crypto wallet. This means they can be only used to send cryptocurrencies, but on an on-demand basis like traditional payment orders.


= What are the fees for withdrawals? =

The fee you will pay for Payouts (one-time crypto withdrawals) is 0.5%. For each payment method a standard network fee applies.

This means that if you send $100 worth of BTC to your contractor, they will receive $100 worth of BTC. You will be charged a transaction fee which will be deducted from your USD or EUR balance.

Settlements (recurrent withdrawals) are free, but bank fees apply.
